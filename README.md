Aerodynamic Analysis of SuperCub model airplane

This code is part of a project for MEAM543, Controls for UAVs, taught by Dr. Bruce Kothmann at Penn.  In this, I use the basic concepts of dimensional analysis in conjunction with parameters from a model airplane to determine the relationship between flight behavior and coefficients of Moment, Lift, and Drag.  This was then used to perform power analysis for the aircraft.
